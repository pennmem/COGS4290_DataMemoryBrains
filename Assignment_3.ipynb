    "For the remaining exercises in this assignment, we will be analyzing neural responses to events using Event Related Potentials (ERPs).  You will be working with data from a single electrode 75 (Oz) (labeled 'E75') in a single subject LTP093 for LTPFR2 experimental sessions. In this and all subsequent exercises, you will analyze the time series of data surrounding each word presentation, from 200 ms prior to word onset until 1,000 ms after word onset. To remove electrical signals that do not reflect neural activity, we use the Localized Component Filtering method (DelPozo-Banos & Weidemann, 2017). To load the LCF-cleaned\n",

    "* Load the scalp EEG data with the `load_eeg()` function by setting the argument `clean=True` and simply don't include the `scheme` argument in the function call to `load_eeg()`. The scheme is only needed for intracranial data and indicates whether monopolar or bipolar-rereferenced EEG should be loaded and for which contacts/bipolar pairs.\n",
    "* Make sure to subset the events to just the WORD or REC_WORD events before loading the EEG. CMLReaders won't load overlapping EEG intervals (i.e. epochs) surrounding events, which will happen if you try to load EEG surrounding all the behavioral events.  Here is some example code:"

    "        * Baseline correction accounts for differing electrical characteristics of each channel, and for the fact that the electrical activity (or roughly speaking, state) of the brain will differ from event to event when the stimulus is presented. What we care about is how much the stimulus impacts the electrical activity of the brain relative to what it was just prior to the stimulus.\n",
