    "## Problem 1: Lists and Matplotlib\n",
    "A question of great intrigue in neuroscience is how do we mathematically describe the activity of individual neurons.  One attempt at this the Izhikevich model, which consists of 3 equations that model the dynamics of a neuron's membrane potential (or voltage in mV) $V$, where $\\Delta V$ is the change in $V$ over each timestep of duration $\\Delta t$ (in ms).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta t} = 0.04V^{2} + 5V + 140 - u + I\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\Delta u}{\\Delta t} = a(bV - u)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "if \\ V \\geq 30 \\ mV, \\ then \\ \\{V \\leftarrow c; u \\leftarrow u + d\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $u$ is a membrane recovery variable, $I$ is the input current (in mA), and $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are free parameters.  Essentially, the first two equations model how the voltage $V$ and recovery variable $u$ change in time, while the third equation indicates that if the voltage reaches a certain threshold, it will be reset to some value $c$.  This reset is meant to symbolize the hyperpolarization that follows the firing of an action potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will simulate the Izhikevich model with different parameter sets to generate unique neuronal behaviors.  We will use the same constants and initial values for each part as defined below, with our simulations running over 300 ms.  For the input current, we will presume that there is 50 ms of no current followed by 250 ms of constant current at 10 mA.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hint: The first two equations correspond to two differential equations, the first of which tells us how the membrane potential changes with time.  If we want to run a simulation that steps forward in time, think of how we can solve for the change in voltage."
