    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "In this assignment you will analyze behavioral data from a big-data study of human memory, particularly the ltpFR2 dataset.  ltpFR2 is a free recall experiment during which each session includes 24 lists, each of which consists of a series of 24 words presented one after another -- we call this the encoding period.  Each list is followed by a distractor, during which participants solves simple math problems, and then a recall period, during which participants attempt to recall as many of the just-learned words as they can, in any order (hence \"free\" recall).  Chapter 1 of Electrophysiology of Human Memory summarizes the principles concerning recall that you will evaluate in this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A note on terminology: Subjects run the experiments in units of \"sessions\". They come into the lab, run the ltpFR2 free recall experiment over the 24 lists containing 24 words each, and then they go home. They then (typically) come back a different day and do it again (for ltpFR2, most subjects completed 24 sessions). Each of these \"trips to the lab\" to collect data constitutes a \"session\". There are several benefits to breaking up the total data collection into multiple sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * We can collect more data. It'd be difficult to impossible to collect 24 (or even 2 or 3) sessions from a person in a single day.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Subjects may for non-experimental reasons perform better and worse on one day vs. another. For instance, someone may sleep poorly the night before a session and do worse than they usually would. Collecting data over multiple days allows us to average out those shorter term variations in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Collecting data over multiple sessions allows us to study practice effects and word familiarity effects.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Some subjects did not complete all sessions.  Include only the subjects that completed all 24 sessions. Additionally, drop the 24th session (which has session number 23 since the sessions are zero-indexed) which used a different variant of the experiment."

Essentially, on our plot, we want IRT on the y-axis, transition position on the x-axis, and a different curve for each number of total recalls on the list.  Each point on the graph should represent an average IRT for the given transition position and total number of recalls.\n",

    "The Lag Conditional Response Probability (Lag-CRP) is a calculation measuring the temporal organization of memory.  When we transition freely from one recall to another, are we more likely to transition between items that were presented close together in time or far apart in time?  See http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/CRP_Tutorial for an example of the concept and FHM figure 6.8 for an example of the graph.  Essentially, at each lag, we divide the number of actual transitions by the number of possible transitions to get a conditional response probability.  Remember that repeats and intrusions (words not from the list) can appear in the recall events, and must be dealt with.\n",
