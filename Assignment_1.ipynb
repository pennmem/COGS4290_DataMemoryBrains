    "## Question 3: Serial Position Curve\n",
    "A serial position curve (SPC) plots the recall probability (vertical axis) as a function of serial position (horizontal axis), as shown in figure 6.1 of FHM.  We define recall probability as the fraction of words successfully recalled.  As with any analyses, there are numerous ways to calculate the SPC, but a good hint is to look at the \"recalled\" status of each presented word.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Write a function to calculate the recall probabilities at each serial position for 1 session.  Then calculate the SPC for subject LTP093, session 0 and plot the results.\n",
    "2) Write a function to calculate the SPC for all sessions for 1 subject.  Then plot the SPC averaged over all of LTP093's sessions.\n",
    "3) Write a function that loops over selected subjects from LTPFR2 and computes a between-subject averaged serial position curve.  This is done by averaging the subject-level SPCs across all subjects.  Comment on the final SPC, what effects does it show?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are smart about it, you should be able to use code from earlier parts of the problem to make later parts much easier!\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes:\n",
    "* Generally, each experimental subject will have different characteristics. A subject-level average provides an estimate of the population mean, i.e. the mean of the population from which these subjects were sampled from (which in the case of LTPFR2, was primarily Penn undergraduates).\n",
    "* Loading these data may take a substantial amount of time. You may want to write your code and then test it over a smaller number of subjects (e.g., 2 subjects). You may also want to load all the data once and then save it out locally as a .csv file (see the pandas.DataFrame.to_csv() function in the pandas documentation). You will then be able to load all of these events from this .csv file much more quickly (see the pandas.read_csv() function).\n",
    "    * Again, some subjects did not complete all sessions. To reduce the variability in your estimates, include only the subjects that completed all 24 sessions. Additionally, drop the 24th session (which has session number 23 since the sessions are zero-indexed) which used a different variant of the experiment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Be sure that your code is robust to exceptions that can be thrown by e.g. unavailable data, and if you have an exception in a particular session due to a problem with the data in that session, print or log the event so you can report it, and discard that session from the analysis (you can use Python try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions). This data was all acquired with human participants across long stretches of time, and small things can go wrong."
