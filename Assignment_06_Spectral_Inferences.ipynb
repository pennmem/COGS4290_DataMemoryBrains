    "## Question 1\n",
    "In this problem you will repeat the prior assignment analysis for all subjects in 'scalp_subs' and make some statistical inferences about spectral biomarkers of successful memory encoding.  \n",
    "* Be sure that your code is robust to exceptions that can be thrown by e.g. unavailable data, and if you have an exception in a particular session due to a problem with the data in that session, print or log the event so you can report it, and discard that session from the analysis. This data was all acquired with human participants across long stretches of time, and small things can go wrong.\n",
    "* Once you have verified your code, compute powers for all subjects as described above and create power spectra for recalled and non-recalled events.\n",
    "* Using the “cmldask” package you should be able to use a separate “core” on the cluster to process data from each session. Only run up to 5 jobs at once with up to 10 GB per job (or your jobs may be killed by mean-spirited admins). Make sure you save out the power values as you go (e.g. with the pickle library).\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Compute the average power spectra for each subject (separately for recalled and non-recalled items) and then take the log of that spectra. Averaging these power spectra across subjects, graph the average log-power spectra with 95% confidence bands (transparent light red and light blue shading, or your favorite clearly labeled color scheme).\n",
    "2) To get a sense for the effect of the log-transform and the semi-log plot, also produce plots without the log-transformation of the subject-level powers and ... \n",
    "3) ... also produce plots without either the log transformation or the semi-log plot.\n",
    "4) Plot the mean of the differences between the log spectra (recalled - not recalled) computed separately for each subject (and then averaged across subjects) on a semi-log plot and place a confidence band on the mean difference score. \n",
    "5) What inferences can you now make from these results?"

    "## Question 2\n",
    "In this problem, your goal is to assess the effects of two important processing steps on the analyses in the previous problem. Two common normalization procedures used in the analysis of brain signals are the log-transform, which attenuates extremely large values, and the z-transform, which allows you to normalize power values according to some baseline distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will reproduce the analysis of the previous problem in computing between-subject differences of power spectra between recalled and not recalled items with each of these steps separately. The log-transform can be applied at different points in the analysis stream: immediately after computing power values, after averaging power values for each encoding interval, or after computing the z-transform of the power values. Similarly, the z-transformation can be done by normalizing to power (or log-power values) based on many choices of the “distribution” of power (or log-power values). If our goal is to normalize data to the distribution of power values across a given session, how do you define the “distribution” over which to estimate the standard deviation of values? Consider three different choices and assess the effects of these choices on your final analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Take the logarithm of power before averaging across time\n",
    "2) Z-score powers across the events within a session after averaging across time\n",
    "3) Complete a third transformation of your choice. \n",
    "4) Describe your motivation in considering the transform (in part 3).  Asses the effects of the different choices (parts 1, 2, 3)."
