This task is the same as a standard verbal free recall task except that the words on each list come a smaller number of categories.

    "Within a session, subjects collected early on would see at most 300 words, 12 words from each of 25 categories. After collecting data from about 120 subjects, we decided to cut the sessions in half but added another category so subjects saw 312 words from 26 categories across two \"half sessions.\" Because the words on the lists come from a small set of categories, we can try to do a similar analysis on these data as they did in the fMRI papers mentioned above, investigating whether the representations of pairs of same category words are more similar than pairs from different categories. In most RSA analyses (like above) the focus is on regions of the brain that are known to respond to the type of stimuli in question. In intracranial EEG though, we don't get to choose where in the brain we are recording from and it's not consistent across patients. Therefore, in the analyses here, to simplify things for this class, we will just use all of the electrodes we get for each patient and look at their similarity. Perhaps surprisingly, as we'll see, this seems to work ok! "

    "If you haven't seen this code pattern yet, it's super useful and comes up all the time in data science. It's called a [split-apply-combine pattern](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01) because we split up the data into chunks, run some code on each of them (here taking the mean correlation), and then recombine them again. You can see more about how this works in `pandas` [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/groupby.html). We then continue taking the average within session, and subject until we finally get to the average similarity between items from a pair of categories in our dataset."

Some subjects' neural activity is more category driven than others so the average similarities vary a lot by subject. It also varies by session and list. Use the split apply combine approach to see what the variability in average similarity looks like across subjects.

Therefore we'll subtract the average similarity within a pair of lists from the `corr_z` column. This gives us only the within-list-pair variance. This is often a [good strategy](https://www.tqmp.org/RegularArticles/vol01-1/p042/p042.pdf) for visualizing effects in studies like this where there is hierarchical structure in the design (subjects/sessions/lists).

They showed that right before you retrieve an item, the neural activity that displayed the drift above looks more similar to the item youre about to retrieve than any other item. On top of that, it is also more similar to serial positions that were near by at encoding. This suggests that you not only retrieve an item but it's general *context*.
